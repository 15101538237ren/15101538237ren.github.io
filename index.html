                    <div>We proposed a deep learning model with a 94% precision and 85% recall to predict real-time traffic accident in cityscale. It on one hand can help traffic police departments arrange their police scientifically and effectively, and on the other hand help people avoiding traffic accident by choosing safer regions. A paper has been submit to <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/aaai18.php">AAAI 2018</a>, and it can be found at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06168">arxiv</a>.

                        <li>With the guidance of my advisors, I proposed the conceive of this project, and finished most experiments. After literature review, I found traffic accident prediction based on deep learning is a promising field, and it is not well understood and addressed. Therefore, I explored and proposed a Deep Learning model for real-time traffic accident prediction with high accuracy and performance.</li>
                        <li>On the basis of Granger causality, I found the importance of factors related with traffic accident can be ranked as:Traffic flow > Traffic accident > Weather ≈ Holiday or festivals > Air quality ≈ Time period.</li>
                        <li>I also found daily periodic feature has more predictive ability than weekly periodic feature and short-term feature in traffic accident prediction.</li>
                        <li>By adding spatial traffic feature into model, I found it can result in performance degradation.</li>

                    <div>DNA methylation patterns have profound impacts on genome stability, gene expression, and development.We constructed a kinetic model of DNA methylation with long-distance correlation between CpG sites, from which a correlation function was established based on experimental data. The obtained correlation function provide insightful understanding for the mechanisms of inheritance of DNA methylation patterns. Our paper can be found at<a href="http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0217979217502435">Collaborations between CpG sites in DNA methylation</a>.

                        <li>The correlation function we proposed consists of three parts that suggest three possible sources of the correlation: movement of enzymes along DNA, collaboration between DNA methylation and nucleosome modification, and global enzyme concentrations within a cell. Moreover, the collaboration strength between DNA methylation and nucleosome modification is universal for mouse early embryo cells.</li>
